______________Installation_________________

1. OpenPNL must already be installed

        We have added a number of build fixes to this version
            https://github.com/PyOpenPNL/OpenPNL
            run ./configure && make && sudo make install

2. This module follows standard swig/distutils installation

        python setup.py build
        sudo python setup.py install

3. python scripts in the examples directory or others importing openpnl should now work
